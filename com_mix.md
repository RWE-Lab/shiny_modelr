## Comparisons of Mix Models
    
After we decide to choose mix models, we want to know which kind of mix model fits the best. This app automatically runs multiple mix models in the backend and compare them automatically using BIC criteria. The details regarding this comparison are reported in a table format. We want the model with smaller BIC and less complexity (random intercept over random slope and intercept if BICs are the same).
