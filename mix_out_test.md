## Mixed Model: Likelihood Ratio Test

We compare our final model which includes a group variable term as main/interaction effects with a conditional model without the group-variable and formally test the fitness of these two models. If there is no statistical significant difference between them, we consider that the study groups would not affect the changes of outcome values.
